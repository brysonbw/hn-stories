## How Can I Contribute?

### Bug Reports

Before creating a bug report please check to see if it has already been reported. If the issue is closed, please open a new issue and link it to the original issue.

When creating a bug report, please fill out the template provided.

### Feature Request

Before creating a feature request, please check to see if it has already been requested.

When creating a feature request, please fill out the template provided.

### Documentation

The documentation for this project are files that end with `.md` extension.

If you would like to improve the documentation in any of these areas, please open an issue if there isn't one already to discuss what you would like to improve. Then submit a pull request to this repository.

### Code

Unsure of where to begin contributing to `hn-stories`? You can start by looking through the issues labeled _good-first-issue_ and _help-wanted_. You can also start by contributing to the project documentation (e.g files with extension `.md`).

For instructions on setting up your environment, see the [setup](#setup) instructions in this document.

## Setup

If you don't already have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, install it first. You will need it to contribute. You will also need to install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to install [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) too. However, if you install Rust as described above, Cargo will be installed automatically.

### Installation

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the `hn-stories` repository.
2. Open a terminal, or "Git Bash" on Windows.
3. Use `cd` to move to the directory that you want to work in.
4. [Clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
5. [Configure the remote repository for your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork).
6. Build and run:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
7. Open the `hn-stories` folder in your favorite editor. If you don't have one, try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> A few additional developer tools you may want to install for this project and and for general Rust development:
>
> - [cargo-watch](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-watch) - Watches over your Cargo project’s source
> - [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy?tab=readme-ov-file#as-a-cargo-subcommand-cargo-clippy) - A bunch of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code
> - [cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) - Audit Cargo.lock for crates with security vulnerabilities

## Linting, Formating, Building, and Testing

Once you have cloned `hn-stories` and completed [Setup](#setup), you can lint, format, build, and test the code from your terminal.

### Linting

To lint the code, run:

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings -A clippy::needless_return
```

> `clippy::needless_return` usually warns about using `return` in functions and methods. For this project, we intentionally allow the `return` keyword and encourage its use for clarity.

### Formating

To format the code, run:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
```

### Building

To compile the `hn-stories` source, run:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Testing

To validate tests in _all_files_ run:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Pull Request

Once you have finished working on an issue or feature, you can submit a pull request to have your changes merged into the `hn-stories` repository and included in the next release.

**Please do not change the project version number in a pull request.**

**Note**: We squash commits into a single commit **before** merging any PRs, so _please do not squash commits while reviewing or during PR creation_.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following:

1. Search for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. Skip this step if you have completed [Setup](#setup). Otherwise, please complete it first and then return here.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

6. Run the tests and ensure no linting errors.

7. Stage and commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix(<scope>): <message>"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Please write commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification, particularly by using a [commit message with a scope](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with-scope-and--to-draw-attention-to-breaking-change). Also, we encourage you to _keep your commits small and meaningul_.

8. Push your branch to your remote fork:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin my-fix-branch
   ```

### Reviewing a Pull Request

Community Leaders reserves the right not to accept pull requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community. Such behavior includes not following the [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Addressing Review Feedback

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. Make the required updates to the code.

2. Re-run tests to ensure tests are still passing.

3. Commit your changes as usual and push them to your feature branch (this will automatically update your Pull Request):

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Address review feedback"
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

### After Pull Request Merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local terminal as follows:

  ```bash
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the main branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout main -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```bash
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

## Keeping Fork Synced with Upstream

- Update your local `main` with the latest changes from upstream:

  ```bash
  git pull --ff upstream main
  ```

- Fetch the latest changes from upstream:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  ```

- Update your local branch with latest changes from upstream:

  ```bash
  git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main
  ```
